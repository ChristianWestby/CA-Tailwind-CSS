# CA-Tailwind-CSS

Social Media App - CSS Frameworks Course Assignment

Overview

This project is a course assignment for the CSS Frameworks module, with the goal of building a responsive front end for a social media application using Tailwind CSS. The focus is on applying CSS frameworks to develop a user-friendly, professional, and mobile-responsive application. I have chosen Option 3 for this assignment, creating a new social media app that includes an Authentication Page, Feed Page, and Profile Page.

Task Brief

Goal

The objective of this assignment is to apply knowledge of Tailwind, Bootstrap, or SASS to build a responsive front-end interface for a social media app.

Brief

For this assignment, there were two options:
	1.	Option 1: Style an existing JS2 CA project using Tailwind, Bootstrap, and SASS.
	2.	Option 2 (Chosen): Create a new social media app with three main pages:
	•	Authentication Page (/index.html): Includes a form for users to log in or register. The form is validated and redirects to /profile on successful login.
	•	Feed Page (/feed/index.html): Displays a list of posts with thumbnails, a search bar, sort options, and a form for creating new posts.
	•	Profile Page (/profile/index.html): Contains user profile information, including a profile image, username, posts, follow button, and follower/following count.

This project uses Tailwind CSS for all styling, focusing on responsive design and utilizing best practices in frontend development.

Requirements

	•	Responsive Design: The site must be fully responsive.
	•	Validation and User Experience: HTML form validation is implemented on the authentication page.
	•	Structure:
	•	Authentication Page: Form for login with a minimum password length of 8 characters.
