# CA-Tailwind-CSS
 
Goal 

To apply your knowledge of Tailwind or Bootstrap and SASS to build a responsive front end for a social media application. 

Brief 

For this assignment you have two options: 

Option 1 

Style your JS2 CA with either Tailwind or Bootstrap and SASS. 

Work on a branch called css-frameworks branched off your JS2 CA branch. 

Ensure package.json includes a development script that uses tools like watch for real-time updates, and a deployment script for building the production-ready code. 

Deploy your site from the css-frameworks branch using a service like Netlify or Github Pages. 

Submit both a PR from your css-frameworks branch to the original branch and a link to the deployed site. 

Option 2 

Create a new social media app with the following pages: 

Authentication page (/index.html) 

Feed Page (/feed/index.html) 

Profile page (/profile/index.html) 

The authentication page should include a form allowing users to log in or register for the application. Include HTML form validation and use /profile as the action attribute on the form. The password must have a minimum length of 8 characters. 

The feed page should have a list of posts with thumbnails, a search bar, sort options and a form to create a new post. You may add additional UI elements beyond these requirements. 

The profile page should have a profile image, username, list of user posts, a follow button and an area to display following/followers. 

Style your new app with either Tailwind or Bootstrap and SASS. 

There is no requirement for JS functionality beyond things like making sure the mobile menu works.  

Create a new repo and perform all your work on a branch called css-frameworks.  

Ensure package.json includes a development script that uses tools like watch for real-time updates, and a deployment script for building the production-ready code. 

Deploy your site from the css-frameworks branch using a service like Netlify or Github Pages. 

Submit both a PR from your css-frameworks branch to the original branch and a link to the deployed site. 

Process 

Create a prototype for each page. 

Create a new git branch for this project called css-frameworks.

Option 3
Important (as mentioned in class) there is an option 3: 
Option 3 is that you can design your own website. It must be of similar scope to option 2 (three pages etc). Have fun with it and challenge yourself. It can be any website design.
